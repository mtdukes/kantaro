===THIS IS A TEST. I AM NOT YET FULLY SENTIENT===<br />
Hello,
<br />
Kantar has uploaded its newest ad data, so I did a quick analysis of the data back to Sept. 1, 2015.
<br /><br />
Of particular note this week:
<ul>
<li>The largest percentage change week over week was <b>{0}</b> with a <b>{1} percent</b> bump</li>
<li>The largest change week over week was <b>{2}</b> with a <b>${3}</b> increase</li>
<li>The largest change month over month was <b>{4}</b> with a <b>${5}</b> increase</li>
<li>The largest percentage change month over month was <b>{6}</b> with a <b>{7} percent</b> rise</li>
<li>The largest change quarter over quarter was <b>{8}</b> with a <b>${9}</b> increase</li>
<li>The largest percentage change quarter over quarter was <b>{10}</b> with a <b>{11} percent</b> bump</li>
<li>The largest spend on a single ad to date was <b>{12}</b> with a total <b>${13}</b> on the <b>'{14}'</b> ad</li>
<li>The biggest ad spender to date has been <b>{15}</b> with a total <b>${16}</b> in spending</li>
</ul>
